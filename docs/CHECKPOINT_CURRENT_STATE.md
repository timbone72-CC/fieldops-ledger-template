## Repo State

- Repo path: `~/projects/fieldledger`
- Branch: `main`
- Current safe HEAD: `87136c8 Update checkpoint after trusted user docs clarification`
- Pushed to `origin/main`
- Working tree was clean before this checkpoint edit.
- Blockers: none

## Confirmed Working State
- Trusted-user go/no-go decision: GO for one controlled trusted tester. FieldLedger is not approved for public release or broad tester rollout yet.
- Clean fresh-device simulation passed: private/incognito browser started with no saved Trusted Sheet setup, JSON backup restored successfully, copied tester Sheet Web App URL had to be re-entered, import token was entered manually, Send to Trusted Sheet succeeded, RawData updated with 1 imported job row, and Timesheet updated to the matching $168.00 total.
- Trusted-user instructions now clarify that calendar testing is optional/advanced for the first trusted-user app test unless the tester is specifically assigned to test calendar reminders.
- Trusted-user release-readiness gate now requires confirming the Trusted Sheet Web App URL setup and import token entry on the exact browser/device being tested.
- Trusted User Release Candidate live workflow drill confirmed Bucking, Torque Turn, expense summary, tax breakdown, JSON backup, CSV export, full report print preview, timesheet print preview, Trusted Sheet send, paired Sheet Timesheet update, and laptop/mobile visual usability.
- Dashboard width issue was observed once during laptop visual review, but could not be reproduced in local or live after retest; no CSS fix was applied and this remains a watch item.
- Trusted Sheet trusted-user instructions now clarify that the Web App URL is saved only per browser/device, the import token is never saved, and every new phone, laptop, browser, or Linux setup must enter setup info before sending.
- Tax estimate clarity polished: Pay Period Summary now includes an expandable Tax Estimate Details section showing taxable income used, self-employment estimate, federal estimate, and state estimate without changing tax formulas or making tax-advice claims.
- Storage contract expanded: `docs/FIELDLEDGER_STORAGE_CONTRACT.md` now documents device separation, persistent-storage limits, backup health, restore-contract verification, photo-reference restore risk, Trusted Sheet source-of-truth boundary, and checkpoint evidence requirements.
- Live offline reload drill confirmed: after opening the live app online once, FieldLedger loads successfully while offline.
- Offline app-shell caching fixed: the service worker now pre-caches the current built JS/CSS assets, only falls back to cached HTML for navigation requests, and Settings blocks Update App while offline to avoid deleting the cached app shell without internet.
- App color theme polished: the UI now uses a cleaner blue/slate work-app palette with soft gray background, white cards, readable dark text, and updated rebuilt GitHub Pages assets.
- Clear Pay Period danger zone polished: the destructive clear action is now inside an expandable warning section, so the backup/clear warning appears only when opened and opening the section does not clear data.
- Export / Backup laptop layout polished: the dropdown panel is constrained, buttons no longer stretch unevenly beside the Trusted Sheet helper area, and Trusted Sheet notes now appear only when that section is opened.
- Saved Jobs list height is now limited so multiple saved jobs scroll inside the panel instead of making the Jobs page endlessly long.
- Job ticket photo cards now show attached-photo status even when a saved image file cannot be previewed by the browser, such as some HEIC/text-message photos.
- Docs-only cleanup completed: `docs/FIELDLEDGER_TRUSTED_USER_RELEASE_READINESS.md` is now the single trusted-user release gate, and `docs/FIELDLEDGER_TRUSTED_USER_SETUP_CHECKLIST.md` references that gate instead of duplicating readiness wording.
- Trusted-user setup checklist now links to `docs/FIELDLEDGER_TRUSTED_USER_RELEASE_READINESS.md` as the release boundary before sharing.
- Added `docs/FIELDLEDGER_TRUSTED_USER_RELEASE_READINESS.md` to define limited trusted-user release readiness and public-release boundaries.
- Trusted-user setup checklist share package now includes the copied Sheet `/exec` Web App URL and copied-Sheet import token.
- Trusted-user instructions now more clearly warn testers to download a JSON backup before importing replacement data or using clear/reset actions.
- Doc-only future company handoff planning slice completed.
- Added `docs/FIELDLEDGER_COMPANY_HANDOFF_CONTRACT.md`.
- Added `docs/FIELDLEDGER_TRUSTED_USER_CONTRACT.md`.
- Added `docs/FIELDLEDGER_SUBMISSION_CONTRACT.md`.
- Added `docs/FIELDLEDGER_PROOF_CONTRACT.md`.
- Updated `docs/CHECKPOINT_CURRENT_STATE.md`.
- No app code, backend, auth, package, or build output changed.
- Current MVP scope is unchanged. The new docs are future-planning only.

- Trusted-user local reference document boundary is now documented in `docs/FIELDLEDGER_TRUSTED_USER_LOCAL_DOCS.md`; local tester setup files remain outside the repo and must not be recreated without first checking `/home/timbone/Documents/FieldLedger-Trusted-Sheets`.

- Blocker follow-up fixed Trusted Sheet URL safety: app-side send now rejects non-Google Apps Script URLs and URLs that do not end in `/exec` before posting the import token or CSV; focused tests confirm rejected URLs do not call fetch.

- Blocker follow-up fixed state tax summary behavior: the main Pay Period Summary now passes the saved editable `stateTaxRate` into the tax estimate calculation.

- User 1 owner-managed Trusted Sheet paired-system validation completed: copied tester Sheet Web App was deployed, FIELDLEDGER_IMPORT_TOKEN was set in Apps Script Project Properties, correct token reached the web import receiver, wrong token was rejected, and the owner verified the copied Sheet output path. This evidence is manual/operator-reported, not an automated repo test.

- Accidental repo-local CSV folder ignore was removed; trusted-user Sheet reference files are kept outside the repo under the laptop Documents folder.

- Export / Backup mobile layout fixed, rebuilt, committed, and pushed: the mobile menu now stacks buttons one per row, and GitHub Pages live assets were rebuilt with stale bundles removed.

- Trusted-user instructions now include a Trusted Sheet Send Test section covering `/exec` URL use, token-not-saved behavior, separate browser/device data, JSON backup restore before sending from an empty device, and tester Sheet versus owner/master Sheet checks.

- Trusted Sheet send guidance now clarifies that users must use the deployed `/exec` Web App URL, that the import token is never saved, and that phone/laptop/desktop browser data are separate.

- Live GitHub Pages Trusted Sheet send polish validation completed: saved Web App URL appears in the send prompt, the import token is still not saved, confirmation appears before sending, and the trusted Sheet RawData/Timesheet path updates successfully from the live app.

- Live phone Trusted Sheet send validated after correcting the `/exec` Web App URL and using the matching import token.

- Apps Script guarded web RawData import completed, pushed, deployed, and live-tested: correct token plus valid csvText imports to RawData through processCsvCore, wrong tokens are rejected, empty CSV is rejected, malformed CSV does not replace RawData, and Timesheet output was verified from the web-imported row.

- FieldLedger app-side Send to Trusted Sheet action completed, pushed, built into GitHub Pages assets, and browser-tested: the Export / Backup menu now includes Send to Trusted Sheet, the cancel path works safely, the button prompts for URL/token without storing secrets, and a successful send updated the trusted Sheet through the guarded web import path.

- Apps Script CSV import refactor completed and pushed: processCsv now wraps processCsvCore and failCsvImport supports optional UI alerts. Later guarded web RawData import work added the RawData web write path after token and CSV validation.

- Manual malformed-CSV failure drill verified: invalid CSV headers fail safely and existing RawData survives unchanged.

- Codex findings-only repo-wide test audit completed: all 11 discovered `*.test.mjs` files passed, no files changed, no fixes applied.

- Full export seam validated: CSV export, JSON backup round trip, backup validation, and timesheet print view tests pass together.

- Corrected verification authority: backup validation test path is `src/features/exports/validatePayPeriodBackup.test.mjs`.

- Trusted-user validation completed for CSV export/import workflow across devices and Windows file-picker filtering behavior.

## Locked Rules

- MVP remains offline-first.
- MVP remains AI-free.
- MVP remains net-zero-cost.
- Manual review is required before saving.
- Bucking pay = hoursWorked × hourlyRateSnapshot.
- Torque Turn pay = baseJobPay + additionalHours × hourlyRateSnapshot.
- Expenses reduce net income but do not change gross earnings.
- Mileage estimate is shown for planning only and must not be treated as a guaranteed deduction.
- Tax estimates are planning only, not tax advice.
- Structured records use localStorage.
- Large photo/blob storage uses IndexedDB.
- Saved records store photo IDs by reference, not image blobs.
- Export visible fields must mimic the submitted Legend Energy timesheet first.
- Extra FieldLedger-only data should stay hidden or secondary in the timesheet export.
- Data Shape Change Rule: any saved record structure change must update or verify every reader/writer of that structure, including save, display, edit/delete, export, import validation, restore, tests, and checkpoint/contract notes.

## Latest Manual Browser Test

- Compact Print Timesheet layout retains single-page landscape output even at 150% Chrome print scaling, confirming additional readability headroom without pagination failure.
- Print Timesheet verified as compact operational export: mileage-enabled timesheet renders successfully in landscape mode on a single printed page.
- Print Full Report verified with mileage-enabled pay period: job data, mileage totals, tax summary, and report sections render successfully in print preview without blank-page failure.
- CSV export verified with mileage present in pay period: Legend-style CSV exports only job rows, excludes mileage rows, and imports cleanly into Google Sheets.
- Live phone print behavior verified after rebuild: print preview opens, main timesheet table is readable, mileage appears below the main table, and no blank print page occurs.
Torque Turn CSV-to-Google-Sheets pipeline passed:

- App exported Torque Turn row with Day Rate 1400 and Additional Hours 7.
- Google Sheet initially calculated Total incorrectly as $346.00.
- Sheet formula was corrected to use Day Rate + Hours Worked × 28 when Day Rate is present.
- Repair Timesheet Formulas was run successfully.
- Torque Turn row stayed correct at $1,596.00.

Latest live recovery test passed:

- Live app initially showed cached/stale print behavior.
- Incognito confirmed updated Print Timesheet spreadsheet view.
- Browser data reset cleared local app data as expected.
- JSON backup import restored saved data successfully.
- Print Timesheet worked after restore.

Previous printable full report test passed:

- Dashboard opened successfully.
- Print Full Report opened browser print preview.
- Timesheet report still showed job/report content.
- Pay Period Summary remained visible.
- Business Miles showed 299.60 mi.
- Mileage Estimate showed $200.74.
- Print preview generated successfully.

## Next Recommended Move

Continue Phase 2 from operational stabilization + integration verification.

Approved next target:

- Run a real backup/restore confidence drill using a full pay period that includes jobs, expenses, mileage, ticket photo references, and receipt photo references.

Goal:

- Prove the current trusted-user data recovery path still works before adding any new feature work.

Do not restart Help, onboarding wording, Update App workflow, or mobile overflow review unless a real issue appears.

## Tracked TODO

- Add future way to manage saved company and rig suggestion lists.
