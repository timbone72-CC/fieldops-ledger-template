# FieldLedger Trusted User Instructions

## 1. Purpose

These instructions explain how a trusted user should test FieldLedger safely.

This is not a public release guide.

## 2. What FieldLedger Is

FieldLedger is a work-record app for tracking:

- job tickets
- pay periods
- expenses
- mileage
- timesheet exports
- calendar reminders

FieldLedger is designed for manual review before saving.

## 3. What You Should Receive

Before testing, you should receive:

- the FieldLedger app link
- your copied Google Sheet link
- the deployed Apps Script Web App `/exec` URL for your copied Sheet
- the import token for your copied Sheet
- the name of your dedicated FieldLedger calendar
- these trusted-user instructions
- a reminder to download a JSON backup before testing destructive flows

Do not use the owner's master Sheet or personal/default calendar for testing.

## 4. Important Data Warning

FieldLedger stores app data in the browser used on that device.

Phone data and computer data are separate unless moved with JSON backup/import.

Before clearing browser data, changing phones, reinstalling the app, importing replacement data, or using clear/reset actions, download a JSON backup.

A JSON backup is the trusted user's safety copy during testing.

## 5. What To Test First

Start with a small test pay period.

Add:

- one Bucking job
- one Torque Turn job
- one expense
- one mileage entry if mileage is being tested

Then verify:

- saved records display correctly
- summary totals look reasonable
- JSON backup downloads
- CSV export downloads
- printable report opens

## 6. Google Sheets Test

Import a small FieldLedger CSV into the Google Sheet.

Confirm:

- RawData updates
- helper sheets update
- Timesheet rows fill correctly
- formulas still calculate
- Grand Total rows stay hidden as expected

## 7. Trusted Sheet Send Test

Use the Export / Backup menu to send the current pay-period CSV to your copied Trusted Sheet.

Confirm:

- the Web App URL uses the deployed Apps Script `/exec` URL
- the Web App URL is saved only in this browser/device after it is entered
- every new phone, laptop, browser, or Linux setup must enter the Web App URL before its first send
- the import token is entered only when sending
- the import token is not saved by FieldLedger
- every new phone, laptop, browser, or Linux setup must enter the import token when sending
- phone, laptop, and desktop browser data are separate
- if this device has no saved jobs, restore a JSON backup before sending

If the send fails, check:

- the Web App URL is the deployed `/exec` URL, not the editor URL
- the import token matches the copied Trusted Sheet setup
- the current browser has saved FieldLedger jobs
- the copied Trusted Sheet is the tester Sheet, not the owner/master Sheet

## 8. Optional Advanced Calendar Test

Calendar testing is optional for the first trusted-user app test unless the tester is specifically assigned to test calendar reminders.

Use the dedicated FieldLedger calendar assigned for testing. Use the exact calendar name provided in your share package.

Do not sync generated FieldLedger work events to a personal/default calendar.

If calendar testing is assigned, confirm:

- CalendarEvents rows generate
- Sync Calendar Events creates events
- eventId values are saved
- syncing the same rows again does not create duplicates
- clearing CalendarEvents staging rows does not delete existing LEG Work Calendar events

## 9. Optional Calendar Rollover Test

Before relying on generated reminders, confirm ScheduleConfig handles:

- month rollover
- year rollover
- payday events
- Sunday timesheet reminders
- Tuesday timesheet due events

## 10. What Not To Test Yet

Do not expect:

- AI
- OCR
- login
- cloud sync
- automatic tax filing
- paid backend services

Tax estimates are for planning only and are not tax advice.

## 11. Reporting Problems

When reporting a problem, include:

- what device was used
- which browser was used
- what button or menu item was clicked
- what was expected
- what happened instead
- whether a JSON backup exists

## 12. Safety Rule

Do not use real critical records as the only copy during testing.

Keep a JSON backup before testing imports, clears, or calendar regeneration.
